Though I was unable to have my peers playtest my game in the way that everyone else in the course was able to, the commentary and visual feedback from Prof. Yarger's playtesting was certainly enlightening. I wasn't too sure in which direction I wanted to go with my game; I thought about an infinite scroller, or perhaps a more action-based game. Ultimately, I landed on more of a puzzle-platformer. Furthermore, it was clear that my mechanics were evidently lackluster and lacked a keen sense of identity/originality. Taking that into condsideration, I reworked my black holes to invert gravity when the player passes through and to curve bullets to hit triggers on the map. I feel as though my game now has a sense of authenticity as a result.
